Its like particle physics in the early 20th Century crossed with the advent of Personal computers in the late 70s!\nNew and exciting frontiers are open to discover the fundamental building blocks of intelligence and the barrier to entry is just a computer with access to the internet. It feels like a unique moment in human history and I am very excited.</p>\n<h2>Starting from Zero</h2>\n<p>My background isn‚Äôt in machine learning or mathematics.  I studied Psychology for 5 years at University but only ever took a couple of papers in statistics.\nAfter reading some of Jeremy Khun‚Äôs Programmer‚Äôs introdution to mathematics ( watching heaps amounts of 3Brown1Blue videos ) I am very excited by the idea of maths. Maybe more importantly, I really believe I can learn mathematics even though it was never my strength before. </p>\n<p>Maybe its not really zero, I am a Javascript developer by trade. Three years ago I was working the most boring job ever, stocking taking chemicals in University labs and putting the data into excel. I was really motivated to do something else, so I quit my job and studied coding using Freecodecamp (ref) for 8months. I was lucky enough to get my first break at Forsite(link). Fast forward to now and I have been coding professionally for 2 years and I love it. </p>\n<p>I have sort of been down this path before. I know I can retrain in a complex field.\nAnd now, I believe I can learn the graduate level mathematics. Deep learning and the mathematics involved is probably much more complex than learning web development and javascript.\nI still feel like an imposter some days.  So why not feel like an imposter doing something exciting like deep learning?</p>\n<h2>So na√Øve</h2>\n<p>Clearly you I am misguided if I believe that you can just learn in 3 months what takes a PhD student years! </p>\n<p>Ok I admit the goal is a little preposterous. I may have gotten the wrong idea from Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas (ref). I found their deep learning for coders course in 2017 <a href=\"#ref_6\"><sup>6</sup></a> and was given the idea that it was possible to learn math even if you were not good at it before AND that its possible to make meaningful contributions to deep learning research even if you didn‚Äôt do a PhD.</p>\n<p>With that blissful ignorance about the difficulty we can happily skip into my plan ‚¨áÔ∏è</p>\n<h1>üß≥ The Plan</h1>\n<p>I hope to build a strong foundational knowledge in the practical methods for building deep learning systems and the mathematics involved. </p>\n<p>Beside each course you‚Äôll see a number which is my arbitrary Full Time Effort metric.<br>\n<strong>1 point</strong> being the full focus of a university paper for <strong>1 semester</strong> ( ~ 12 weeks ).\nOf course it is arbitrary, but my idea behind this is to quantify, like in Scrum (ref), the complexity of AND effort I will spend on each course. Basically the less effort the more content I will skip from the course.</p>\n<p>The plan comes out to about 7.5 points. By the above definition this is nearly twice the amount of work I can fit into 12 weeks!\nLets see what happens‚Ä¶</p>\n<h3>Machine Learning and Deep learning</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Course/Book</code></th>\n<th>FTE</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Fastai</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 1 (2019)</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Deep Learning Part 2 (2019) (not released yet)</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Deeplearning.ai</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Deep learning specialization<a href=\"#ref_1\"><sup>1</sup></a></td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td><em>$45</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Jeremy Khun</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Programmers Introduction to Mathematics Book <a href=\"#ref_2\"><sup>2</sup></a></td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">MIT</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- XXXX Single Variable Calculus</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- 18.02 Multivariable Calculus</td>\n<td>0.4</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- 18.06 Linear Algebra</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data analysis, signal processing and machine learning</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">3Blue1Brown</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Essence of Linear Algebra &#x26; Calculus</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Khan Academy</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Linear Algebra &#x26; Calculus</td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Udemy</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Swift - iOS app development <a href=\"#ref_3\"><sup>3</sup></a></td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n<td>$11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">- Python for data science and machine learning <a href=\"#ref_4\"><sup>4</sup></a></td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n<td>$11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code class=\"language-text\">Resources</code></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">GPU server instance  - AWS p2 instance &#x3C;200 hours<a href=\"#ref_5\"><sup>5</sup></a></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>~$300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Total</td>\n<td>7.4</td>\n<td>~$367</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<h2>üìú Do you get a certificate?</h2>\n<p>I get asked this question by alot by friends and family when I tell them my plan.</p>\n<p>The answer is No.\nWhile I will get a certificate for completing deeplearning.ai (because I paid), I don‚Äôt trust this will be enough proof for anyone. Especially as you can see above that this certificate will only account for a small amount of my overall learning!</p>\n<p>When I first learnt to code my certificate was my projects. People had not heard of FreeCodeCamp then so their certificates were not worth much. The projects I built during the FreeCodeCamp curriculum were however undeniable proof. Github was the proof. You can hire me to write <em>javascirpt to build websites</em>, because here, I have built websites using javascript.</p>\n<p>Rightly or wrongly I will follow this philosophy for deep learning.\nModels in production with code on Github, implementing papers in code and technical writing will be my certificate of proficiency for deep learning.</p>\n<h2>Why not do a Masters?</h2>\n<p>Good question. I would have the chance to basically do what I am doing but in a more supported environment with capable peers to collaborate with and learn from etc. </p>\n<p>There are three reasons (apart from the fact I am not sure if I could get straight into a program without any compsci degree)</p>\n<p><strong>First is the cost:</strong>\nA Masters in NZ would cost at least 10k plus the opportunity cost of one years income. If I study online I can cut this cost greatly and probably get access to on par course content from places like MIT open courseware. </p>\n<p><strong>Low Risk</strong>\n3months study wont cost much and it lets me see if I can do it. There are alot of unknown with switching to a almost completely new area of programming. I can figure out if I actually like doing machine learning! Committing to a whole year of a Masters is big gamble when I really don‚Äôt know if its for me yet.\nIn the end if its not for me, well I can get a job writing Javascript again ( I love being a JS developer, so it‚Äôs a great second best ) </p>\n<p><strong>The Cutting edge is online</strong>\nI don‚Äôt want to learn to write matlab, or even R really. It seems to me that University Academia can very often be behind the cutting edge of Computer Science. Many of the things a Comp Sci grad needs for a developer job they will learn outside of uni.\nI think we are in a unique moment in history. I believe the field of machine learning is has a majority of advanced content avaliable for free on the internet. </p>\n<p>Finally, I think I can get a job in deep learning without a masters. I will just need a bit more hustle.</p>\n<h2>You dont know what you dont know</h2>\n<p>I like the above quote because I feel it summarises way you are encouraged to think about complexity in the software development ideology of scrum (ref).<br>\nYou have to be honest about the unknown complexity of the thing you are doing. There are things that you will learn about the problem you are solving along the way. By definintion these things will be <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>. That is, you cant really prepare for them. You have to go in knowing that your understanding will change.</p>\n<p>For me, this idea holds for the learning process as well. Your understanding of what more you need to learn will expand and change as you learn more and understand your problems better.</p>\n<p>Back to the current problem. I have self studied to break into a completely new field before. So at least the <em>process</em> of embarking on a new endeavour like this is not completely new to me.<br>\nBut I have to be honest. I am not sure if I will be good or enjoy mathematics or deep learning.\nI also don‚Äôt really know about the state of deep learning research.</p>\n<p>But I am happy to find these things out, and I am happy to be wrong. Well if not happy I can come to accept it‚Ä¶ </p>\n<p>In the very least at the end of 3 months, I will have a pretty good idea of what I don‚Äôt know. </p>\n<h2>üß† Anki and Michael Neilson:</h2>\n<p>Part of this project that I am super excited about is my own meta learning project. Using Anki application/method to be as efficient as possible with my time spent learning.\nI was super inspired by an great post by Michael Neilson on Augmenting cognition (ref long but excellent read).\nThe post puts forward a some ideas and practical observations from using the personal memory system Anki.\nThe main thesis about learning goes something like this: Thinking about complex subjects is built upon many small bit of knowledge similar to how a chess grandmaster see a whole board at glance and understands it as collection of moves and strategies. Whereas a novice is overwhelmed and cannot fathom the whole 40 pieces at once! The grandmaster can break down the board into chunks of strategy which can be used a </p>\n<p>Micheal posits that a primary drag on cognition is that fact that we cannot reliably remember facts or theories are learning. That is that in general people do not retain most of what they study. The results of my university career attest to this. </p>\n<p>Anki is spaced repetition based flash card app. You write cards like below. When you answer them you rate how hard it was. With this information, the anki app will then remind you to review the card at an interval.\nThe whole idea is to hack the forgetting curve (ref). If you retreive the information at the correct time, you can strengthen the memory of the information.</p>\n<figure>\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p>Cultivate a taste in what to Ankify</p>\n\t\t<footer>\n\t\t\t<cite>‚Äî Michael Nielsen</cite>\n\t\t</footer>\n\t</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>My biggest takeaway from the article is the advice:\n‚ÄúCultivate a taste in what to Ankify‚Äù </p>\n<p>That is, the process of making your flash cards is the most important. A question can be too hard, too simple, unconnected to your other knowledge. You may have not understood the concept and reminding yourself to think about it will not magically make you understand it. I experienced all of these. It feels like you just have to do the time to understand when to add some thing and what kind of card is good to add.</p>\n<p>I will be spending so much time learning that the idea of radically improving my retention of the knowledge excites me so much! I intend to write more about my experience with these techniques as I find out what works for me.</p>\n<p>( Michael has written a more recent article about the strategy for using anki to extridite the process of deeply understanding mathematical theory (ref) )</p>\n<h2>Why I wrote this post?</h2>\n<p> I was a little terrified to write this blog post. In my mind I had a few\u000bdifferent reasons to do it.\n( A public and social commitment to my goal; Encourage others like me;  Share some insights that might be useful to others )</p>\n<p>Mostly I have to blame Rachel Thomas and Jeremy Howard:</p>\n<figure>\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p>You have a unique perspective that is valuable for someone who is just behind you in the learning process. You understand what its like to be where they are,  better than someone further on</p>\n\t\t<footer>\n\t\t\t<cite>‚Äî Rachel Thomas & Jeremy Howard</cite>\n\t\t</footer>\n\t</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>I will be writing more, with that simple but powerful idea in mind.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a id=\"ref_1\"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>I intend to take the deeplearning.ai course as supplement to fastai practical deep learning courses</em><br>\n<a id=\"ref_2\"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>This book got me excited about the ideas and magic of mathematical proofs and the beauty behind it.
